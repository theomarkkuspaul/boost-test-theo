# Atbash is a simple substitution cipher possible with any known alphabet. 
# It emerged around 500-600 BCE. It works by substituting the letters of an alphabet with another.
â€‹
# English alphabets in order is the constant.
# CONSTANT = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# A random shuffle of the constant is the ciper.
# example cipher 'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba'
# Using the cipher text are encypted.
# When the cipher and encrypted text is given it possible to decrypt the encrypted text.
#
# Example 1
# ---------
# CONSTANT       = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# cipher         = 'zodvqukgwefbyitmrsplhacxnj'
# encrypted text = 'dzs'
# original text  = 'car'
#
# Example 2
# ---------
# CONSTANT       = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# cipher         = 'xipmuzfkbrlwotjancqgveshdy'
# encrypted text = 'skd qj qucbjvq?'
# original text  = 'why so serious?'
#
# Challenge
# ---------
# CONSTANT       = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# cipher         = 'oephjizkxdawubnytvfglqsrcm'
# encrypted text = 'knlfgnb, sj koqj o yvnewju'
# original text  = ?
#
# Decrypt the given encrypted text. Any character other than what you have in the constant doesn't have to be replaced.
